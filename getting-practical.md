# Let's Get Practical: Starting Your Project

Now that you've gone through the course and understand what it takes to be a successful maintainer, let's get practical and start your first open source project as a maintainer!

## Prerequisites

You'll need to have the following:

- [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- A [GitHub Account](https://github.com)

## Choosing Your Project 

Sometimes the hardest part is deciding what you're going to work on. Here are some general ideas to get you started:
   - Identify a problem or need in the open source community.
   - Think about a topic you're passionate about that others might be interested in as well.
   - Think about a problem that you've had to solve that others can benefit from.

Don't think too hard about it now. You can always go back and update things later. 

## Create Your Repository

We're going to walk through the steps to set up your project in GitHub. This isn't the only way to get started with a project, but it's the way we're going to demonstrate. 
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in.
   - Click on the "+" icon in the upper right corner and select "New repository."
   - Enter a repository name, description, and choose whether the repository should be public or private.
   - Initialize the repository with a README file and add a license.
   - Click "Create repository."

## Adding Repository Documentation

Now that you have the repository, you can either edit it directly in GitHub or clone the project and work on it locally. 


 ## Set Up Contributing Guidelines
   - Create a new file named `CONTRIBUTING.md` in your repository.
   - Outline the process for submitting issues and pull requests.
   - Include coding standards, style guides, or any specific requirements.
   - Mention how contributors can ask for help or clarification.

## Issue Templates and Labels
Write your first issue
   - In your repository, click on "Settings" and then "Issues."
   - Set up issue templates for bug reports, feature requests, etc.
   - Add labels to your repository like "good first issue," "enhancement," "bug," etc.



## Promote Your Project
    - Share your project on social media, forums, and relevant communities.
    - Write blog posts or tutorials about your project.
    - Present your project at meetups, conferences, or online webinars.
    - Create a Highlight


## Recognize All Contributions
    - Use tools like the [All Contributors](https://allcontributors.org) bot to acknowledge different types of contributions.
    - Highlight contributors in your README or on your project's website.
    - Thank contributors publicly for their work.

## Start Contributing to Your Own Project
    - Commit your initial code, documentation, or other materials to the repository.
    - Use the same process you've set up for other contributors to model best practices.
    - Regularly contribute to and update the project.

## Monitor
    - Use tools like OpenSauced Insights to monitor the project's activity.
    - Solicit feedback from users and contributors.
    - Reflect on the project's direction and make adjustments as necessary.

Congratulations on creating your first project! Remember, these steps are guidelines; the key to a healthy open source project is to foster an open, inclusive, and collaborative environment.
