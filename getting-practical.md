# Let's Get Practical: Starting Your Project

Now that you've gone through the course and understand what it takes to be a successful maintainer, let's get practical and start your first open source project as a maintainer!

## Prerequisites

You'll need to have the following:

- A [GitHub Account](https://github.com)

## Choosing Your Project

Sometimes, the hardest part is deciding what you will work on. Here are some general ideas to get you started:

- Identify a problem or need in the open source community.
- Think about a topic you're passionate about that others might be interested in.
- Think about a problem you've had to solve that others can benefit from.

Don't think too hard about it now. You can always go back and update things later. For now, if you need a place to start, let's create a repository about your favorite open source resources.

## Creating Your Repository

We will walk through the steps to set up your project in GitHub. Although it's not the only way to get started with a project, it's the one we'll use in this demonstration.

- Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in.
- Click on the "+" icon in the upper right corner and select "New repository."
- Enter a repository name and description, and choose whether the repository should be public or private.
- Initialize the repository with a README file and add a license.
- Click the "Create repository" button.

If you're using our starter idea, you could use the following:

    - Name: favorite-open-source-resources
    - Description: A markdown file of resources I've found most helpful.

## Adding Repository Documentation

Now that you have the repository, you can either edit it directly in GitHub or clone the project and work on it locally. We previously learned about how to create detailed READMEs, contributing guides, and codes of conduct in "[How to Setup Your Open Source Project](/how-to-setup-your-project.md)". If you need a reminder, take a look back at that chapter.

### Creating Your README

Your project already has a README file, but it's a good idea to update it with information about your project. Here's a template you can use:

```markdown
# Project Name

## Overview

Provide a brief, high-level overview of your project. Include the goals and core values of the project. Explain how it contributes to the open source community and any specific problems it aims to solve.

## Table of Contents

- [Overview](#overview)
- [Getting Started](#getting-started)
  - [Installation](#installation)
  - [Usage](#usage)
- [Contributing to the Project](#contributing-to-the-project)
- [Acknowledgments](#acknowledgments)
- [License](#license)

## Getting Started

### Installation

Instructions on how to install the project. Include any prerequisites or dependencies.

### Usage

Guide on how to use the project, including any configuration steps or basic examples.

## Contributing to the Project

General instructions on how to submit contributions to the project with a link to your CONTRIBUTING.md file. Also, include information on how to engage with the community and maintainers.

## Acknowledgments

Show appreciation for the community's contributions, including developers, writers, and any other contributors.

## License

State the license under which the project is released and provide a link to the full license text.
```

### Adding a License

You should have initialized your project with a license, but if you did not, you can add a license to your project by creating a new file named `LICENSE` in the root of your repository. You can use the [Choose a License](https://choosealicense.com/) website to help you select the right license for your project.

### Setting Up Contributing Guidelines

Your project will likely have similar contribution guidelines to other projects. You can follow these steps to create guidelines and provide a template. However, if you need a specific example, you can always refer to the [OpenSauced Contributing Guidelines](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/contributing/introduction-to-contributing/). Feel free to use those guidelines and update them as you see fit for your project.

- [ ] Create a new file named `CONTRIBUTING.md` in the root of your repository.
- [ ] Outline the process for submitting issues and pull requests.
- [ ] Include coding standards, style guides, or any specific requirements.
- [ ] Mention how contributors can ask for help or clarification.

#### Contributing Guidelines Template

### Setting Up a Code of Conduct

It's essential to have a code of conduct to ensure that everyone feels welcome and safe in your project. Here's how to set up a code of conduct:

- [ ] Create a new file named `CONTRIBUTING.md` in the root of your repository.
- [ ] Copy and paste the code of conduct you'd like to use. We recommend using the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).
- [ ] Add a link to the code of conduct in your README and CONTRIBUTING files.

!> Make sure you attribute the code of conduct to the original author.

### Using Issue Forms, Pull Request Templates, and Labels

Creating good issues and using labels will help to create a strong project. Before creating your first issue, start by creating issue templates to make the process of submitting an issue clear to your contributors.

#### Creating Issue Forms

In this section, we will create an issue template for a bug report. You can also create templates for other types of issues, such as feature requests, questions, or documentation requests.

Below are the steps to create the template. After the steps, we'll share with you what we use at OpenSauced. Feel free to copy and paste that information into your repository and update it as needed.

##### Bug Report

- [ ] Create a new folder named `.github` in the root of your repository.
- [ ] Within that folder, create a new folder named `ISSUE_TEMPLATE`.
- [ ] In the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` directory, create a new file named `bug_report.yml`.
- [ ] Add a name (üêõ Bug report), description (Create a bug report to help us improve Open Sauced üçï) to the template, and title ("Bug: ").
- [ ] If there are specific labels you want automatically generated when this issue is created, add them to the template. (`labels: [üëÄ needs triage, üêõ bug]`)
- [ ] Next, you'll add the body, which includes the type and attributes for each section. This generally contains a checklist of steps to reproduce the bug. As part of that section, you should:
  - [ ] Add a section for the expected behavior and actual behavior.
  - [ ] Add a checklist of steps to reproduce the bug.
  - [ ] Add a section for screenshots, if applicable.
  - [ ] Add a section for additional context, if applicable.
- [ ] Finally, add a section for the code of conduct and contributing docs.

Here's what we use at OpenSauced:

```yml
name: üêõ Bug report
description: Create a bug report to help us improve Open Sauced üçï
title: "Bug: "
labels: [üëÄ needs triage, üêõ bug]
body:
  - type: markdown
    attributes:

  - type: textarea
    attributes:
      label: Describe the bug
      description: A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
    validations:
      required: true
  - type: textarea

      options:
        - label: I agree to follow this project's Contribution Docs
          required: false
```

##### Feature Request

Now, let's follow the same process and make a feature request template.

- [ ] In the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` directory, create a new file named `feature_request.yml`.
- [ ] Add a name (üöÄ Feature request), description (Suggest an idea for this project üí°), and title ("Feature: ") to the template.
- [ ] If there are specific labels you want automatically generated when this issue is created, add them to the template. We use üëÄ needs triage, üí° feature.
- [ ] Next, you'll add the body, which includes the type and attributes for each section. This generally contains a checklist of steps to reproduce the bug. As part of that section, you should:
  - [ ] Add a section for the expected behavior and actual behavior.
  - [ ] Add a dropdown for the type of feature request.
  - [ ] Add a section for the suggested solution.
  - [ ] Add a section for screenshots, if applicable.
  - [ ] Add a section for additional context, if applicable.
- [ ] Finally, add a section for the code of conduct and contributing docs.

Here's what we use at OpenSauced:

```yml
name: üöÄ Feature request
description: Suggest an idea for this project üí°
title: "Feature: "
labels: [üëÄ needs triage, üí° feature]
