# The Power of Metrics and Analytics for New Maintainers

Understanding what's happening with your project and contributors as it grows can be challenging for new maintainers. Think of metrics and analytics like a compass and map in your maintainer journey. Understanding metrics for open source projects and your own project can help you to set goals, identify project needs, and understand your community. This chapter will guide you through understanding, leveraging, and making decisions based on these insights to create a thriving open source project.

## Understanding Types of Metrics

- **Code Metrics:** Code metrics provide a quantitative measure of the codebase's state, focusing on aspects that impact its quality, maintainability, and scalability.
- **Community Metrics:** Community metrics shed light on the human element of the project, highlighting the growth, engagement, and overall health of the surrounding community.
- **Project Health Metrics:** Project health metrics provide insights into the project's responsiveness, efficiency, and overall well-being.

Considering a holistic approach to metrics can ensure you're not overly focused on one type to the detriment of others. For example, while high code quality is important, it should be balanced with strong community engagement to ensure a sustainable project future.

Diverse metrics offer a more complete picture of a project's health and potential areas for growth or improvement. This could include balancing code metrics with community and project health metrics to ensure the project is not only technically sound but also welcoming and engaging for new contributors. It's about finding the right mix that supports your project's goals and values, fostering an environment where the codebase and the community thrive together.

## Setting Project Goals

Setting clear and achievable goals can help you with project management. can help you with project management. Your goals might vary and include improving code quality, expanding the community, or streamlining issue resolution. When you set specific goals, you're better able to make decisions about prioritization and using resources (don't forget, time is a resource!).

Remember, goals for your open source project are final. They will evolve as the project grows. Metrics can inform these changes, providing insights that reveal new opportunities or challenges. For instance, if a project sets an initial goal to increase contributor numbers but later finds that engagement or quality is suffering, it might shift focus towards improving onboarding processes or documentation.

Maintainers should regularly review their goals in the context of the project's current metrics and broader trajectory. This adaptability ensures the project remains aligned with its community's needs and your vision as a maintainer.

Choose metrics that align with your project's priorities. For example, if community growth is the goal, focus on new contributor rates and engagement levels. Below are some examples of metrics you may want to track.

### Community Growth Goals

- **New Contributor Rates**: Tracking new contributors can be a key indicator of your project's appeal and growth potential.
- **Active Contributors**: The count of contributors who have made at least one commit, pull request, or comment in the last month.
- **Community Engagement**: Engagement metrics might include the number of comments on issues and pull requests, PR reviews, or the number of members in your community space (Slack, Discord, etc.).
- **Retention Rate**: The percentage of new contributors who continue contributing over time, indicating how well the project retains its community members.

### Code Quality Goals

- **Documentation Coverage**: Having documentation coverage ensures your project is accessible to newcomers and reduces the entry barrier for contributors.
- **Commit Frequency**: Knowing the commit frequency can help you understand the project's development activity over time and can help you identify trends in contribution, potential stagnation, or support needs.

### Project Health Goals

- **Issue Velocity**: How quickly issues are closed. This can reflect how quickly the concerns are acknowledged, an important aspect of project responsiveness.
- **Pull Request Velocity**: How fast pull requests are closed. This can help you see how efficiently problems are solved.
- **Benchmarking**: Use OpenSauced to establish current metrics as benchmarks, setting realistic targets for improvement.
- **Timeline**: Set a clear timeline for achieving these goals, creating a sense of urgency and momentum.

## Understanding and Interpreting Open Source Project Data

Understanding and interpreting data helps us to understand and share the story behind the numbers. Some ways to do this include:

- **Trend Analysis**: Look for patterns over time, such as cyclical increases in contribution activity, to plan for future resource allocation.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unexpected spikes or drops in metrics and investigate potential causes, such as new feature releases or community events.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare metrics against similar projects to gauge your project's performance in the broader open source ecosystem.

## Making Data-Driven Decisions

Making data-driven decisions involves using the insights you've gathered to guide your project's direction.
For example, if you see that your project has a high number of new contributors but a low retention rate, you might decide to focus on improving the onboarding process for new contributors.

A great way to make data-driven decisions about your project is to create a Workspace in OpenSauced. This will allow you to bring together repositories, insights, and collaboration tools in one place.

## Creating a Workspace for Your Project with OpenSauced

An OpenSauced [Workspace](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/features/workspaces/) serves as your project's command center, where you can learn more about your project and share it with others. This section guides you through creating and optimizing a Workspace to manage your project efficiently.

To create a Workspace:

1. Log in to your [OpenSauced account](https://app.opensauced.pizza/). Once you're there, click the "Workspace" dashboard, and you should see your personal workspace.
2. Click on the "Edit" button. You'll be prompted to name your workspace and add repositories.
3. Add your project's repository.
4. Click "Create Workspace" to create your Workspace.

Within the repositories dashboard, you can view the following metrics, which are over a period of thirty days by default:

- **Pull Requests**: This includes the total opened and merged pull requests for the repositories included in your workspace, as well as the velocity of pull requests being merged.
- **Issues**: This includes the total opened and closed issues for the repositories included in your workspace, as well as the velocity of issues being closed.
- **Engagement**: This includes the total stars, forks, and activity ratio for the repositories included in your workspace.

?> **Tip**: You can customize the time period for these metrics by selecting 7 days, 30 days, or 90 days from the dropdown menu.

If you want to benchmark your project against other similar projects or if you'd like to create a list of repositories for inspiration, you can create a [Repository Insight](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/features/repo-insights/) in your Workspace.
