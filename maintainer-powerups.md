# Maintainer Power Ups

As maintainers, we have many various daily tasks. We often juggle triaging new issues, reviewing pull requests, testing changes, and managing and moderating the community, such as welcoming new contributors and thanking contributors for their contributions, among many other tasks. And most of the time, we are expected to respond to these tasks promptly. Sometimes, these never-ending tasks are overwhelming.

However, some tools and features on GitHub allow us to automate tasks and help us to make our work lighter. In this chapter, we will talk about these maintainer power ups from GitHub.

## GitHub Actions

Let's say your project receives many new issues and pull requests daily. You want to welcome each new contributor, thank them for their contributions, and tell them you will triage their issues and review their PRs. You want to do more but don't have time to respond to them because you're still busy with something else.

Setting up GitHub Action to automate these tasks will save you time in responding to contributions individually. Here, at OpenSauced, we set up GitHub Action to [welcome new issues](https://github.com/open-sauced/app/blob/beta/.github/workflows/issue.yml), allow contributors to [assign themselves to an issue](https://github.com/bdougie/take-action), block issues from getting assigned when they still need to be [triaged](https://github.com/open-sauced/app/blob/beta/.github/workflows/triage.yml), and many more. Other repositories also have their own GitHub Actions set up based on the needs of each repository.

If you want to use GitHub Actions in your project, you can search for them on the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions). You can [create your own actions](https://github.com/features/actions) or customize them from existing GitHub Actions if you don't see the one you need.

Here are some additional resources to give you more information about GitHub Actions and how to set one up:

## Saved Replies

Sometimes, you repeatedly write the same reply to issues or pull requests. It's crucial to keep clear communication between maintainers and contributors. So, when you write all comments manually, your message will no longer be consistent, and they may be unclear. You can create saved replies when you frequently respond to issues and pull requests with the same comments.

[Saved replies](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-saved-replies/about-saved-replies) allow you to create a reusable response to issues, pull requests, and discussions and use it across repositories. It will save you time responding to contributors while keeping the consistency of your message. You can always modify your replies if necessary.

Read the GitHub documentation for complete instructions about how to [create saved replies](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-saved-replies/creating-a-saved-reply).

## Code Owners

Most of the time, contributors don't know the maintainers of a project, so they don't know who to add as reviewers. When they create a PR, they usually leave a comment like, "Can you please review my PR?" But usually, maintainers don't get notified about this new PR and comment, causing it to be missed from the radar. Adding the CODEOWNERS file to the repository will help you to automate and tackle this issue.

From the [official GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners):

> You can use a CODEOWNERS file to define individuals or teams that are responsible for code in a repository.

There are some benefits to having this file in your repository:

- **Review request notification**

  Once you have specified who can review and maintain a repository, these code owners are automatically notified and requested for review when someone opens a pull request that modifies code that they own. That way, you don't need to add reviewers manually.

- **Prevent contributors from manually adding reviewers**

  When a PR comes from external contributors, they cannot add reviewers manually. That way, they don't have to comment on the PR, and it also helps you by preventing them from adding non-maintainers — such as regular contributors — as reviewers.

- **Branch protection**

  If you opt-in to "Require approval" and "Require review from Code Owners" to protect a branch, a certain number of code owners must approve any pull request before the pull request can be merged into the protected branch.

You can read the official GitHub documentation for complete instructions to [create the CODEOWNERS file](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/creating-new-files).
