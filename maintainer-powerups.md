# Maintainer Power Ups

As maintainers, we have many various daily tasks. We often juggle triaging new issues, reviewing pull requests, testing changes, and managing and moderating the community, such as welcoming new contributors and thanking contributors for their contributions, among many other tasks. And most of the time, we are expected to respond to these tasks promptly. Sometimes, these never-ending tasks are overwhelming.

However, some tools and features on GitHub allow us to automate tasks and help us to make our work lighter. In this chapter, we will talk about these maintainer power ups.
