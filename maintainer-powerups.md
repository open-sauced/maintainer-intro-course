# Maintainer Power Ups

As maintainers, we have many various daily tasks. We often juggle triaging new issues, reviewing pull requests, testing changes, and managing and moderating the community, such as welcoming new contributors and thanking contributors for their contributions, among many other tasks. And most of the time, we are expected to respond to these tasks promptly. Sometimes, these never-ending tasks are overwhelming.

However, some tools and features on GitHub allow us to automate tasks and help us to make our work lighter. In this chapter, we will talk about these maintainer power ups.

## GitHub Actions

Let's say your project receives many new issues and pull requests. You want to welcome each new contributor, thank them for their contributions, and tell them you will triage their issues and review their PRs. You want to do more but need more time to respond to them because you're still busy with something else.

Setting up GitHub Action to automate these tasks will save you time to reply to contributions individually. Here, at OpenSauced, we set up GitHub Action to [welcome new issues](https://github.com/open-sauced/app/blob/beta/.github/workflows/issue.yml), allow contributors to [assign themselves to an issue](https://github.com/bdougie/take-action), block issues from getting assigned when they still need to be [triaged](https://github.com/open-sauced/app/blob/beta/.github/workflows/triage.yml), and many more. Other repositories also have their own GitHub Actions set up based on the needs of each repository.

If you want to use GitHub Actions in your project, you can search for them on the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions). You can [create your own actions](https://github.com/features/actions) or customize them from existing GitHub Actions if you don't see the one you need.

You can read this blog post for more information about GitHub Actions.
