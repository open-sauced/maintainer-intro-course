# üåê i18n Guidelines

Welcome to our i18n Guidelines! We appreciate your interest in translating our Intro to Open Source course.

At the moment, we have the course in the following languages:

- English

## How Can I Contribute?

There are two types of i18n contributions that we accept:

1. Translate our Intro to Open Source course.
2. Review pull requests (PRs) and translations.

### Translate the Intro to Open Source Course

We have two types of translations:

#### 1. Official Translations

Official translations start as a post on our [discussion board](https://github.com/open-sauced/maintainer-intro-course/discussions). If there is enough interest and volunteers, we can add the official translation as an option to view within our README.

#### 2. Community Translations

We can't always support the maintenance of translations. However, we know some contributors are willing to translate, and we value these contributions. For that reason, we have a Community Translations section.

If you're interested in translating our Intro to OSS course, fork this repository and add the translation to your forked repository. Then, you can add a link to your translation in the `community-translations.md` file.

We encourage you to add it to the [discussion board](https://github.com/open-sauced/maintainer-intro-course/discussions) as well. We will consider moving it to an official translation if it becomes popular and has enough support.

### Review Pull Requests (PRs) and Translations

If you are familiar with the translated language(s), you can help us review the translations and the PRs. Please head over to our [Reviewer Process Guide](#reviewer-process-guide) for more information.

## Adding Translations

First, please read our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to setting up the project locally and for the technical instruction. Then, follow these steps to add the translations:

1. **Identify target languages**.

   Determine which languages you want to add translations for. Make sure these languages are relevant to the project's user base.

2. **Create translation files**.

   Inside the "translations" directory, create a new subdirectory for each language you plan to support. Use language codes (e.g., "en" for English, "fr" for French) as directory names.

   ```markdown
   .
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ translations/
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ en/ (English)
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fr/ (French)
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ es/ (Spanish)
   ```

3. **Translate content**.

   - For each language directory, create translated versions of the documentation files. Typically, you translate Markdown files but consider other formats as needed.
   - Maintain the same file names and structure as in the original documentation but with translated content.

4. **Update links**.

   In the translated files, ensure that any internal links (e.g., links to other sections or pages within the documentation) are updated to point to the corresponding translated content.

5. **Add language selector**.

   Adding a language selector to the documentation allows users to switch between languages. You can do this by modifying the languages menu on the navigation bar:

   1. Open the `navbar.md` file in the `_layout` folder.
   2. In the "Languages" list, add a link to your translated language that includes the icon of the country's flag. Refer to the shortcode column in this [Country Flag emoji cheat sheet](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet#country-flag) to help you.

      ```markdown
      - [:jp: Japanese](/translations/jp/)
      ```

6. **Testing and validation**.

   Test the translated documentation to ensure accuracy and readability. Ensure all links work correctly and the content is culturally appropriate.

7. **Submit translations**.

   If you haven't already, submit your translations as a PR. Ensure you provide clear information about the languages you've translated and any specific details related to your contributions.

8. **Collaborate and review**.

   Collaborate with other contributors and reviewers to ensure the quality of translations. Be open to feedback and suggestions for improvement.

### Best Practices for Translations

- Maintain consistency in terminology and style throughout the translated documentation.
- Work with another contributor who speaks the language you're translating to.
- It helps to mention specific tools you use so developers who want to translate documentation can see how it's done.
- Keep translations up to date with changes in the original documentation.

## Reviewer Process Guide

When it comes to reviewing a translation PR, ask yourself the following questions:

- Does the current translation match the instructions in the English version?
- Are there links that could be localized and translated? (e.g., Wikipedia and MDN links)
- Is the translation correctly written following the translated language's norms and practices?

When you think a PR is ready to be merged after your suggestions were addressed (if any), approve it through GitHub's "Review Changes" button or leave an "LGTM!" in the comment section and tag the `@open-sauced/docs` maintainers. (‚ÄúLGTM‚Äù is an abbreviation of ‚ÄúLooks Good to Me‚Äù or ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Get to Merging‚Äù, often used to approve pull requests.)
