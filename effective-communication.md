# How to Create Effective Communication and Collaboration

Effective communication and collaboration with contributors are the keys to a thriving open source community. As maintainers, you want to smoothly onboard new contributors to your projects and build a welcoming community with open lines of communication between contributors and maintainers.

In this section, we will discuss how to onboard new contributors, utilize different communication channels for your open source project's community, and maintain healthy communication.

## Project Onboarding

Onboarding new contributors to your project is important to maintaining its health and growth. And that will become possible through establishing effective communication, starting from your project's documentation.

Providing clear information and directions about the project's goals, processes, and codebase is the key to helping new contributors collaborate. Effective communication allows you to attract contributors to return, learn more about your projects, and continue contributing. That way, you can create a sustainable ecosystem where knowledge is shared, responsibilities are distributed, and the project can continue to evolve and grow.

There are some ways to establish effective communication on your project to achieve good collaboration.

### Clear Documentation

An easy-to-understand and well-organized documentation will ensure a good onboarding experience for new contributors. Clear documentation can save time, prevent errors, and promote transparency and accountability, which can be vital for effective communication. It is best to invest time and effort in creating clear documentation for your project.

Consider these when you write or update your documentation:

- **Use simple language and universal examples**

  You want to ensure that your documentation is easy to understand by most contributors — if not everyone — including non-native English speakers.

- **Clear guide**

  Whether it's the setup guide on the README, instructions to run and use the project, or Contributing Guidelines, you always want to provide a clear direction for contributors to follow for better collaboration.

- **A dedicated place for documentation**

  If your README is growing longer, consider creating a new file or repository dedicated to your project's documentation. This will ensure a good documentation flow, allowing you to communicate your project better.

### Issue Labels

Labeling issues is an excellent way to categorize and communicate the status of issues in your project. It can also be a way to create contributors' paths.

The `good first issue` label is perfect to be added to beginners-friendly issues. Think of contributors who are beginners in the tech stack or open source in general. It can be a good starting point for them to contribute to your project. Consider pointing to the code blocks and providing step-by-step instructions to work on the solutions for this type of issue.

If an issue is complicated and has to be fixed promptly, you can add `core team work`, `critical`, or any other label based on your project's convention to prevent frustrations and confusion.

### Issues and Pull Request Templates

Having issues and pull request templates in your project makes it easier for you to triage and review them and helps contributors understand how to approach the project and what you expect them to look closer at when creating one.
