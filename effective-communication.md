# How to Create Effective Communication and Collaboration

Effective communication and collaboration with contributors are the keys to a thriving open source community. As maintainers, you want to smoothly onboard new contributors to your projects and build a welcoming community with open lines of communication between contributors and maintainers.

In this section, we will discuss how to onboard new contributors, utilize different communication channels for your open source project's community, and maintain healthy communication.

## Project Onboarding

Onboarding new contributors to your project is important to maintaining its health and growth. And that will become possible through establishing effective communication, starting from your project's documentation.

Providing clear information and directions about the project's goals, processes, and codebase is the key to helping new contributors collaborate. Effective communication allows you to attract contributors to return, learn more about your projects, and continue contributing. That way, you can create a sustainable ecosystem where knowledge is shared, responsibilities are distributed, and the project can continue to evolve and grow.

There are some ways to establish effective communication on your project to achieve good collaboration.

### Clear Documentation

An easy-to-understand and well-organized documentation will ensure a good onboarding experience for new contributors. Clear documentation can save time, prevent errors, and promote transparency and accountability, which can be vital for effective communication. It is best to invest time and effort in creating clear documentation for your project.

Consider these when you write or update your documentation:

- **Use simple language and universal examples**

  You want to ensure that your documentation is easy to understand by most contributors — if not everyone — including non-native English speakers.

- **Clear guide**

  Whether it's the setup guide on the README, instructions to run and use the project, or Contributing Guidelines, you always want to provide a clear direction for contributors to follow for better collaboration.

- **A dedicated place for documentation**

  If your README is growing longer, consider creating a new file or repository dedicated to your project's documentation. This will ensure a good documentation flow, allowing you to communicate your project better.

### Issue Labels

Labeling issues is an excellent way to categorize and communicate the status of issues in your project. It can also be a way to create contributors' paths.

The `good first issue` label is perfect to be added to beginners-friendly issues. Think of contributors who are beginners in the tech stack or open source in general. It can be a good starting point for them to contribute to your project. Consider pointing to the code blocks and providing step-by-step instructions to work on the solutions for this type of issue.

If an issue is complicated and has to be fixed promptly, you can add `core team work`, `critical`, or any other label based on your project's convention to prevent frustrations and confusion.

### Issues and Pull Request Templates

Having issues and pull request templates in your project makes it easier for you to triage and review them and helps contributors understand how to approach the project and what you expect them to look closer at when creating one.

## Regular Communication

Providing spaces outside your project for contributors to ask questions, request guidance, and give ideas is recommended. That way, they can communicate and collaborate actively with other collaborators and maintainers.

Here are some channels for you to consider to create regular communication:

### GitHub Discussions

[Discussions](https://github.com/features/discussions) is a collaborative communication forum for the community around an open source project. It's a feature on GitHub to ask questions, share ideas, and build connections with each other. You can easily enable discussions in your project by following the [complete instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/quickstart#enabling-github-discussions-on-your-repository).

### Discord Community

> [Discord](https://discord.com/) is a voice, video and text communication service used by over a hundred million people to hang out and talk with their friends and communities.

You can create a community around your project and gather them in Discord. Besides allowing contributors to ask questions, connect, and collaborate in nearly real-time, it can also benefit you. You can announce project updates, ask for help, hold sync office hours to talk about your projects and know your contributors better, and many more.

### Slack Group

Like Discord, [Slack](https://slack.com/) provides a platform for your community to chat, connect, and collaborate.

You can automate tasks like scheduling announcements and integrating software and custom apps right into Slack — for example, connecting Slack to a [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) meeting room, etc.

Which one to choose — Slack or Discord — is based on your preference and the needs of your community.

### Community Forum

Another place to create a communication space is a forum. A community forum is an online space where community members connect, engage, and discuss topics with each other.

You can create and host a forum on a website. Or, you can make it a subdomain of your website. Take [freeCodeCamp forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/) as an example for inspiration.

## Effective Communication

Effective communication is key to project success. It plays a vital role in resolving issues, building trust and transparency, and encouraging collaboration. By enabling open and healthy communication, you can ensure everyone is on the same page and working towards a common goal.

### Engaging with Contributors

Having contributors come back and continue contributing to the project is one of the maintainers' goals. To nurture this relationship, you should have time to engage with your contributors between tasks.

Start by acknowledging and thanking them for the issue or pull request they created. Ask them questions if something is not clear enough for you. Keep your message clear and short so they can understand your purpose. When you deliver a few topics, using bullet points in a comment or splitting your message into several comments is recommended.

One of the golden rules in an international remote environment is never to make an assumption. Async communication, more often than not, can lead to misunderstanding because writing is different from speaking. People with different cultural and language backgrounds might need help explaining their intentions or understanding specific cultural sayings. Consider using words with explicit meanings when you are communicating.

Another way to engage with your contributors is by holding a regular office hour. In sync, you can hear their ideas and challenges, communicate with them about your project's direction, and more. This can be a good way to get to know your contributors closer and vice versa.

Maintainers are human. Sometimes, when you're tired or having a bad day, a discussion with a contributor can upset you. Remember that you always want to foster a healthy communication and welcoming environment. It's okay to wait to answer them. You can take a couple of hours or even a day before you return to them to avoid a bitter tone.
