# Building and Nurturing a Welcoming and Supportive Community

Open source is more than just maintaining and improving a project. It's a dynamic environment where maintainers, contributors, and users come together to collaborate, contribute, and grow. So, the people are the core and heart of open source.

As more and more people engage and contribute to your projects, it becomes crucial for you to provide them with the necessary support and motivation to establish a welcoming and positive community environment. Doing so can build stronger relationships and promote a sense of belonging among your community members to keep them returning and remaining dedicated.

In this chapter, you will learn how to build and nurture a welcoming and supportive community in open source.

## Positive Community Culture

There are many types of people when talking about engagements in a community. Some are actively engaging, some come and go, and some are lurkers. But one thing is sure: everyone has the same interest (your project), and they bring value to your project. You always want to ensure everyone feels welcomed, included, and, most importantly, safe in your community. And one of the keys to achieving that is fostering a positive community culture.

### Open Communication

You want to encourage open communication in the community. Open communication allows everyone to understand what's happening around the project and community and helps to build trust and better collaboration. Everyone should feel comfortable expressing their thoughts and ideas and should be able to listen and respond to others in a respectful manner. You can read the chapter [How to Effectively Communicate and Collaborate](./communication-and-collaboration.md) for some tips about communication and collaboration.

### Diversity and Inclusivity

Creating a safe and welcoming community environment involves prioritizing inclusion and promoting diversity. Inclusion means treating everyone with value, regardless of their background, beliefs, or opinions. By fostering a culture where everyone is encouraged to be authentic while appreciating others, you can nurture a community where everyone feels respected and valued. Building a community where everyone feels they belong is the most important thing.

### Guidelines

Every open source project should have a Code of Conduct as a clear set of guidelines for how members within the community should behave and treat each other. You can, for example, emphasize the importance of using positive and inclusive language, treating others with respect, and avoiding discrimination or harassment. Inform them of the consequences they may face if they do not follow the guidelines. A Code of Conduct helps to prevent conflicts, promotes respect, and ensures that everyone in the community feels safe and comfortable. To create one, you can read the [How to Write a Code of Conduct](./how-to-setup-your-project.md#how-to-write-a-code-of-conduct) section.

### Addressing Conflicts

Imagine you're seeing a member behave disrespectfully towards another member on Discord. Or you receive an incident report from a member saying someone harasses them. Addressing conflicts is crucial to fostering a positive culture. If you don't promptly resolve them, your community will no longer feel safe and will lose their trust in you. You can read more about managing conflicts in the [Handling Difficult Situations](./communication-and-collaboration.md#handling-difficult-situations) section of the [How to Effectively Communicate and Collaborate](./communication-and-collaboration.md) chapter.

### Leading by Examples

Leadership is not about being in charge. It's about taking responsibility and setting an example for others to follow. You want to demonstrate positive behavior, be respectful to others, and be willing to listen and learn. Doing so will make others follow the same steps as yours.
