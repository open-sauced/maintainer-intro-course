Welcome to the Becoming a Maintainer Course with OpenSauced! This course is designed to provide you with an introduction to how to become an open source maintainer and guide you through the process of creating your open source project, working with contributors, and more.

## Course Overview

The course is divided into X chapters, each covering a different aspect of being an open source maintainer:

### [Intro: Understanding the role of an open source maintainer](/intro.md)

### [Chapter 1: Setting Up Your Project](/how-to-setup-your-project.md)

### [Chapter 2: Issues and Pull Requests](/issues-and-pull-requests.md)

### Additional Information

As this is the beginning of your open source maintainer journey, we've also provided additional information in these chapters:

- [Glossary](/glossary.md): A glossary of common terms and definitions used by open source maintainers.
- [Additional Resources](/additional-resources.md): A list of resources for further learning about being an open source maintainer, including blog posts, tutorials, and guides.

## Getting Started

To start the course, navigate to the [`intro` file](/intro.md) in the repository or visit the [Intro to Open Source with OpenSauced website](https://maintainer.opensauced.pizza/) and start reading! Each chapter builds on the previous one, so we recommend reading them in order.

As you work through the course, we encourage you to experiment with the tools and concepts covered in each chapter. The best way to learn is by doing, so try contributing to an open source project or building your project from scratch!

## Building Your Open Source Resume

One of the unique features of this course is that it guides you to build your open source resume using OpenSauced. OpenSauced is a platform that helps you track and showcase your open source contributions, making it easier to get noticed by potential employers and collaborators.
